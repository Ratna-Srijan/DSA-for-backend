# DSA for Backend

This repository contains my structured Data Structures & Algorithms practice, focused on concepts commonly used in backend development.

The goal is not competitive programming, but building strong problem-solving skills relevant to real-world backend systems.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

Backend systems frequently rely on:

- Efficient data handling
- Fast lookups
- Optimized querying
- Memory-aware logic
- Clean algorithmic thinking

This repository helps strengthen those foundations.

- HashMap & HashSet
- Stack & Queue
- Recursion
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)
- Basic Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS)
- Sliding Window & Two Pointers

---

## 🛠 Structure

Problems are organized by topic. Each solution includes:

- Problem name
- Approach explanation
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Clean Java implementation
